		<div class="col-md-3" title="Worst. Hero. In the Galaxy.">
		<h3>Arthur Dent</h3>
		<p>Here's our recipe for Arthur Dent: Take one hero. Now remove everything heroic. Voilà: You've just made Arthur Dent. Okay, that's a little harsh, but only a little. If this were a book by almost any other science fiction author, Arthur Dent would either fight off the alien invasion; or discover a way to use the Improbability Drive to save the world; or even just get romantically involved with Trillian. But what we get here is a protagonist who mostly wanders around in a confused daze and gets things explained to him.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-3" title="Bad Doctor Who">
		<h3>Ford Prefect</h3>
		<p>If you gave Ford the choice between going to a party and saving an entire world from destruction, he would choose going to a party every time. So Ford Prefect looks a lot like a terrible Doctor Who, especially since he is unable to protect his human companion, Arthur, and that, as we all know, is the most important job of all space hobos. For instance, when the Heart of Gold is threatened by nuclear missiles, Ford tries to save everyone but doesn't know how to fly the ship:</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-3" title="Worst Dressed Sentient Being in the Known Universe">
		<h3>Zaphod Beeblebrox</h3>
		<p>Zaphod is the President of the Galaxy who steals the Heart of Gold ship. He's the semi-cousin of Ford Prefect; he has three arms and two heads; and people love to list his qualities. We're not kidding about those lists. When we first meet Zaphod, we found that he is an "adventurer, ex-hippy, good timer (crook? quite possibly), manic self-publicist, terrible bad at personal relationships, often thought to be completely out to lunch".</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-3" title="The one & only Girl">
		<h3>Trillian</h3>
		<p>Trillian is this amazing… oh, who are we kidding? Arthur gives Trillian a terrific description, noting that she's "Beautiful, charming, devastatingly intelligent". Trillian doesn't really get a lot to do. That's a real shame, because she does show off two very important qualities in those few moments when she gets some of the spotlight. (Admittedly, it's hard to get the spotlight away from Zaphod.) First, she's smart and very math-friendly; second, she's what we'll call "adult-nice." </p>
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-3" title="A supercomputer with Emotions">
		<h3>Deep Thought</h3>
		<p>Deep Thought is the giant, city-sized computer that works for 7.5 million years to come up with the answer to life, the universe, and everything. The answer is 42—the problem is we don't really know what the question is. It's also the computer that comes up with the idea for another, earth-sized computer (called "Earth") that will come up with the question. It's an emotional computer, and it gives what seems like a nonsensical answer to life, the universe, and everything.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-3" title="The Parannoid robot">
		<h3>Marvin</h3>
		<p>Marvin the Robot is like Eeyore from Winnie the Pooh: they are both severely depressed, and the one activity they do enjoy is telling you all about how depressed they are. So there's really never any doubt about what Marvin is feeling or thinking. When Arthur gushes about how beautiful a binary star sunset is, Marvin briefly notes, "It's rubbish". That sort of declarative, short, sad sentence doesn't really leave a lot of room for discussion. We're not surprised when Arthur soon stops trying to talk to him. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-3" title="Most annoying robot">
		<h3>Eddie</h3>
		<p>Eddie is the most annoying shipboard computer in the history of science fiction, and that includes all science fiction that has not yet been written. Eddie is in charge of the Heart of Gold, including all of its doors and elevators. When we first meet Eddie, he is relentlessly cheery—which is totally annoying. For instance, the doors on the ship thank people for using them. Marvin is especially annoyed by these doors, and we can't blame him. There's something a little distressing about a computer being programmed to enjoy being used.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-3" title="Dangerously Funny">
		<h3>Vogon Jeltz</h3>
		<p>Jeltz is the captain of the Vogon fleet that destroys the Earth, and he is representative of the Vogons as a whole: he's cruel, bureaucratic, and he writes terrible poetry. In that way, they contrast nicely with Ford Prefect, who is pretty flexible in his approach to life: when the planet he's on gets destroyed, he catches a ride; when he's about to be thrown out of an airlock, he tries to convince the Vogons about the wonders of culture, and so on. It's hard to imagine a Vogon doing anything but sitting down heavily on something in those situations. </p>

<h1>My Favourite Character</h1>
	<div class="marv">
		<p><span class="head">Marvin</span> is a severely depressed robot. He's regularly so depressed that, when he gets bored and talks to other computers, they commit suicide and die, as was the case for a robotically controlled police ship (which resulted in the asphyxiation of two policemen) and a bridge which killed everyone on it. This is due to the "Genuine People Personality" he received while he was being manufactured by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation (Marvin's is a personality prototype). Marvin also dislikes the cheerful GPP doors that were built into the spaceship Heart of Gold. Marvin continually says that his brain is the size of a planet (in fact because of this, he is eternally bored because nothing takes up his entire mind), enabling him to calculate the probability of just about anything. However, when he bothers to share the fruit of his mental labours with those around him, they tend to ignore him because he usually just ends up depressing them. In his spare time, which has been legendary because any time that he commits to thought processes necessary to perform any assigned duties takes up such a small percentage of his brain, and with all of the travelling through space and time performing assigned duties have rendered him many times over the span of the universe, he has been known to write and sing songs; just not very good ones and not very well.</p>
